# Marine Aquarium Drawing Application

## Project Vision 

An intuitive drawing application which allows users to sketch their perception of what the National Marine Park is. The application will likely be used unsupervised and by people of various ages, therefore, it must have a simple interface and be easy to use.

### Scope 

A simple drawing application which works on various devices and input methods (touch, mouse). The application should contain a small selection of brushes (pen, pencil, crayon), colours and brush sizes. 

### Out of Scope 

Features such as layers, rotating the drawing, colour gradients and a wide range of brushes are out of the scope of this project.
